In the depths of my childhood, there was an ineffable weight that I carried. It was not a physical burden, but rather an intangible heaviness that settled upon my small shoulders. It was a weight that no one else could see, but I felt it with every fiber of my being.

It was the weight of expectations, of societal norms and familial obligations. A weight that whispered in my ear, reminding me to be proper and obedient, to walk the straight and narrow path. It filled me with anxiety and fear, constricting my young heart and stifling my burgeoning dreams.

I carried this weight through the hallowed halls of my school, where the weight of knowledge pressed down upon me, demanding perfection. I carried it on my daily walks home, where the weight of responsibility settled upon me, urging me to be the reliable one, the one who could be counted on.

But amidst the darkness of this weight, there was also a glimmer of something else. A weight of anticipation, of hope and possibility. It was the weight of my dreams, of the stories I carried within me, waiting to be set free.

This weight lifted me up, fueled my desire to explore the world beyond the confines of my small town. It propelled me to seek solace in the words of poets and the lens of cameras. It taught me to embrace the weight, to use it as a catalyst for creation, for unearthing the hidden truths that lurked within.

And so, I carried this weight with grace and resilience. I embraced it as a part of my essence, for it shaped me into the storyteller I am today. It may have been burdensome at times, but it also gave me the strength to overcome obstacles and find beauty in the darkest corners.

As I reflect upon my childhood and the weight I carried, I am reminded of the delicate balance between burden and inspiration. It is in the weight that we find our purpose, our drive to create and capture the world in all its complexity. And for that, I am grateful.
