As a child, there was a game I loved to play. A game that held a certain kind of magic, a curious enchantment that seemed to suspend time and space. It was called "Bending Back."

On warm summer days, when the sun bathed everything in its golden glow, my friends and I would gather on the smooth, sun-kissed asphalt of our neighborhood street. And with a sense of excitement bubbling within us, we would begin.

The rules were simple, yet carried a weight of danger and exhilaration. We would form a line, one by one, and carefully position ourselves facing forward. Then, with a deep breath, we would bend backward as far as our young bodies would allow, arching our spines like graceful bridges defying gravity.

But it wasn't just about the physical act, for within the bend, a world unfolded. As our bodies contorted against the pull of gravity, time slowed down. The familiar houses and trees, once standing tall, appeared upside down, their shapes morphing into something otherworldly.

I remember the rush of blood pounding in my ears, the exhilarating mix of fear and pure joy coursing through my veins. In that moment, I felt alive, connected to something greater than myself. The world around me blurred into a dream-like haze, as if reality itself was bending back with me.

Each time I bent backward, I would let my gaze wander upwards towards the endless sky. And there, amidst the cotton candy clouds and the infinite blue, I would catch glimpses of something mysterious. Something that whispered secrets only the clouds could understand.

And as I held my position, my body trembling with effort, I felt a profound sense of achievement. A whispered voice inside me whispered, "You are capable of bending back, of seeing the world from a different perspective."

But as with most childhood games, there came a time when we outgrew our desire to bend backward. Our curious bodies became less flexible, our movements less daring. And though we moved on to other adventures, that game of bending back remained etched in my memory like a fleeting melody.

Now, years later, as I reflect on that simple game, I realize it was much more than just a childhood pastime. It was a metaphor for life, a reminder that sometimes, in order to truly experience the world, we must be willing to bend, to challenge our perspectives, and see things from different angles.

In that bending back, I discovered a glimpse of wonder, a touch of the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. And it is a lesson I carry with me as I navigate the winding paths of adulthood, always looking for opportunities to bend back and discover the magic that lies just beyond the surface.
