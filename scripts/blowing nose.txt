As a child, blowing my nose was a ceremony,
a ritual shrouded in mundane enchantment.
I can still recall the melancholy sound,
as I pressed a tissue to my tiny button nose,
inhaling the world's whispers, exhaling my woes.

My nose, a curious vessel, forever curious,
it felt like a gateway to hidden mysteries,
a conduit between two realms, lost and found.
With each forceful burst, a symphony of release,
the crescendo of a blocked passage breached.

But oh, the art of the proper blow was elusive,
a delicate dance of timing and technique.
Sometimes too weak, the tissue barely rustled,
a half-hearted attempt, a failed performance.
Other times too strong, a violent expulsion,
the tissue torn to shreds, like waves crashing upon jagged rocks.

I became fascinated with the nuances,
the subtleties of nose-blowing artistry.
To this day, I marvel at the symphony you can create,
the cacophony of sniffs, snorts, and sniffles,
a harmonious symphony sculpted by the nose, the maestro.

Blowing my nose was not merely functional,
but a moment of introspection, a chance for solitude.
I would retreat to hidden corners, like a hermit,
a seeker of solace amidst the chaos of childhood,
where I could listen to the whispered secrets of my nose.

And as I blew, in that moment of release,
there was a brief respite from existence,
an ephemeral suspension of time and place.
In those seconds, the world faded into oblivion,
leaving me alone with the symphony of my nose.

Even now, in adulthood's complex symphony,
I find solace in the simple act of blowing my nose.
A moment to pause, to breathe deeply,
to remember the child within, the curious soul.
For in that fleeting moment, I am pure and unburdened,
connected to the essence of my being,
through the melancholy sound of my nose,
as I inhale the universe and exhale my woes.
