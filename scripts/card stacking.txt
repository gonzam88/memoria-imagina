I remember the long summer days of my childhood, with their endless stretches of time and boundless imagination. It was during those languid afternoons, as the sun painted golden hues across the sky, that I discovered the art of card stacking.

In the quiet corners of my room, with the hum of cicadas serenading my thoughts, I would carefully arrange decks of cards, one atop the other, with balanced precision. Each card became a fleeting moment frozen in time, a delicate architecture defying gravity's pull. It was a dance between fragile playing cards, a dance that I choreographed with unwavering determination.

The cards, well-worn and softened by countless shuffles, became my canvas, my medium for creative expression. I would build towering structures that reached towards the heavens, their foundations resting on nothing but slender pillars of air. The anticipation, the sheer delight of watching my creation grow, was pure joy coursing through my veins.

I remember the initial elation as the first few cards aligned effortlessly, forming a solid foundation. The cards seemed to possess a life force of their own, as if they knew the importance of maintaining their unity. And as I added each card, my heart would beat in sync with the delicate balance, holding my breath with every new layer.

But with each triumph came echoes of uncertainty. A slight breeze, a misplaced breath, and my masterpiece would collapse with a muffled flutter. It was a battle against time, against the inevitability of failure. And yet, I persisted, undeterred by the fragility of my endeavor.

In those stolen moments of solitude, time stood still, cocooned in a universe of my own making. The world outside faded into a distant hum as I became entranced by the symphony of fluttering cards. It was a momentary refuge, a sanctuary where dreams could take flight and possibilities were as endless as the summer sky.

As the evening sun cast long shadows through my window, casting a golden glow upon the playing cards, I would revel in the culmination of my efforts. The stacked cards stood defiantly, a testament to perseverance and the beauty of fleeting art. And even in their eventual collapse, I found solace, knowing that impermanence was woven into the very fabric of life.

Card stacking, a seemingly simple act, held within in it the essence of creation, the transience of beauty, and the fragility of existence itself. It ignited a fire within me, a drive to capture those fleeting moments of magic and translate them onto the screen.

And as I reflect now, years later, on those long summer days, I am reminded of the profound lessons learned from card stacking. It taught me the value of patience, the resilience of the human spirit, and the inevitability of change. It was a whisper in my ear, urging me to capture the ephemeral beauty of life, to weave stories that resonate with truth and emotion.

In that small corner of my childhood room, I discovered a profound connection to the world, an understanding that art can emerge from even the simplest of actions. And as I embark on my journey as a filmmaker, I carry with me the spirit of card stacking, the enchanting alchemy of creation and impermanence, forever etched in my heart.
