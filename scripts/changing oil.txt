As a child, I witnessed a ritual that resonated with me deeply, a dance between man and machine that would leave an indelible mark on my soul. It was the changing of the oil, an act of devotion to the engine's well-being, an intimate connection between human and mechanical heartbeat.

I remember the acrid smell that permeated the air, mingling with the sweat on my father's brow as he crouched beneath our aging automobile. The metallic clinks and whirs, like a mechanical symphony, accompanied his hands, calloused and weathered, as they cradled the wrench and executed a delicate twist.

In that moment, time slowed down, lending an ethereal quality to the scene. Drops of spent oil fell like the tears of a forgotten deity, cascading onto the concrete floor with a mournful rhythm. Each droplet carried with it fragments of forgotten journeys, whispered secrets of distant landscapes traversed and forgotten.

As my father drained the lifeblood of the machine, I felt the pulse of vulnerability intertwine with a sense of renewal. The old giving way to the new, a cosmic exchange between man and mechanism, an unspoken promise that the years would be kind, and the engine would hum to life once more.

The oily residue clung to my clothes, staining my young skin with the essence of transformation. I found beauty in the irreverent patterns swirling and smearing, an abstract painting of mechanical resilience. The iridescent hues shimmered like distant galaxies, reminding me that even from the darkest corners, beauty can emerge.

But amidst the spectacle, it was the sensation of closeness, the unspoken bond formed between father and child, that held the true significance. In those moments, I felt his devotion, his unwavering commitment to our family's well-being. It was an act of love, sealed with the bond of shared experience and understanding.

Oftentimes, we find poetry in the most unexpected places - in the act of changing oil, the mundane transformed into a transcendent moment. It was there, in the dimly lit garage, that I learned the language of connection, the dialogue between human and machine, and the fleeting nature of time.

As I reflect on that childhood memory, I am reminded of the power of ritual, of the beauty that lies within the mundane. And though the oil has changed many times since then, the essence of that experience continues to guide my artistic sensibilities, preserving the spirit of vulnerability, transformation, and connection in my films.
