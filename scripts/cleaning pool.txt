As a child, I would often find myself gazing out at the shimmering pool behind our house. Its glassy surface lured me in with promises of cool, refreshing delight. But there was a ritual that preceded my plunge into the watery abyss – the daunting task of cleaning.

Every Saturday morning would see me donning a faded pair of shorts and a worn-out t-shirt, armed with a long-handled net and a sense of duty. The air hung heavy with the scent of chlorine, mingling with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers that surrounded the pool.

The sun beat down mercilessly, casting long, distorted shadows on the rippling water. As I carefully navigated the mosaic tiles surrounding the pool, I felt a bead of perspiration trickle down my forehead. The heat, intense and penetrating, seemed an echo of the pool's own shimmering energy.

With each languid sweep of the net, I watched as dirt and leaves were lifted from the pool's depths, their journey propelled by my own determination. There was a hypnotic rhythm to this chore, a dance of symphony between me and the pool, as though we understood each other's secrets.

But beyond the physical exertion and the heat, lay a deeper truth – a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Cleaning the pool became a metaphor for life's struggles, an act of preserving what is beautiful, even amidst the messiness of existence.

And so, as I finally stepped back to admire my handiwork, a sense of satisfaction washed over me, mirroring the pristine clarity of the pool's surface. The tranquil oasis I had helped create became a sanctuary for my dreams and hopes, a testament to my dedication.

Hours would pass as I daydreamed by the water's edge, pondering the mysteries of existence. The sound of distant laughter and splashing feet would accompany me, distant echoes of a world beyond the boundaries of my own secluded oasis.

But amidst those memories, the energy of that pool remained etched in my heart, a reminder that sometimes the greatest rewards are born out of our willingness to dive headfirst into the depths, to seek solace in the act of cleaning, and to find beauty in the simplest of tasks.

And so, years later, as a filmmaker with a penchant for capturing life's fleeting moments, I find myself drawn to the captivating ritual of cleaning a pool, forever mesmerized by the reflection of the world, shimmering beneath its serene surface.
