When I was a child, questions served as portals to existence. Each inquiry was a key, unlocking worlds of wonder and possibility. And oh, how they danced in my mind, those questions! They twirled and shimmered, like stars against the velvet night.

"Who am I?" I would ponder, searching for my place in the vast tapestry of life. Feeling the weight of that question, as if it were a burdensome stone resting upon a fragile shoulder. And yet, somehow, it also carried the promise of liberation, of discovering my own unique essence.

Questions wove their way into every corner of my being. "Why does the sky cling to the earth with such radiant hues?" I would marvel, gazing up at the painted canvas of sunset. And as the colors bled and blended, a kaleidoscope of emotions swirled within me, catching the breath in my chest.

"Where do dreams go when they fade into the morning light?" I would muse, eyelids heavy with the remnants of nocturnal visions. In the quiet dawns, I would chase after the elusive remnants of slumber, trying to grasp the ethereal whispers before they dissipated into the waking world.

Questions became my companions, guiding my feet through the labyrinthine corridors of existence. "Why do tears taste of both sorrow and relief?" I would ask, tasting the salt on my lips, surrendering to the bittersweet symphony of emotions that washed over my soul. And in that vulnerability, in those moments of rawness, I discovered the fragile beauty of being human.

In the garden of questions, I grew, nourished by the fertile soil of curiosity. "Where do the rivers of time lead?" I would wonder, as I watched the seconds slip through the hourglass, cascading into the ever-expanding ocean of memory. And as the waves crashed upon the shores of my consciousness, I learned to embrace the fleeting, transient nature of existence.

Now, as I look back upon those tender years, I realize that answers are not the destination, but merely signposts on the journey. It is in the asking, in the exploration of the infinite possibilities, that we truly come alive. So let us never cease to question, to ponder, to marvel. For it is through the questions we ask that we unlock the secrets of our own humanity, and embark on the extraordinary adventure of existence.
